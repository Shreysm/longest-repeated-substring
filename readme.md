# longest-repeated substring

Finds the longest repeated substring. There are two implementations, one is Brute Force approach and other is using dynamic programming.
The report contains analysis of both the codes with time complexities.

Programming Language : Python 
Python Version:2.7
Source Code:LRSbrute.py,LRSdynamic.py

## Steps to compile and execute:

In command line,

**Brute Force Program**
python LRSbrute.py <inputstring>

Example

python LRSbrute.py AABEBCDD
Output
Longest Repeated Sequence:  ABD

**Dynamic Program**

python LRSdynamic.py ATACTCGGA
Output
Longest Repeated Subsequence:  ATCG
